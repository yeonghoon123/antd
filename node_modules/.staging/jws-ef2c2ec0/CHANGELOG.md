## [3.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `jwt.verify` now requires an `algorithm` parameter, and
  `jws.createVerify` requires an `algorithm` option. The `"alg"` field
  signature headers is ignored. This mitigates a critical security flaw
  in the library which would allow an attacker to generate signatures with
  arbitrary contents that would be accepted by `jwt.verify`. See
